hello all uh today we are here to discuss a critical aspect of modern automative technology which is the Cyber physical security in Advanced Driver assistance system or also known as Adas in smart cars so with the increasing Reliance on technology and uh internet enable systems in vehicles um you know such as navigation safety and entertainment these advancements also introduce potential vulnerabilities so Adas being a pivotal part of today's smart cars is designed to enhance safety and improve the driving experience but however as these systems become more interconnected they also face growing cyber threats that could compromise Vehicle Safety so in this presentation we will explore the various vulnerabilities present in Adas the risks they possess and the strategies to mitigate these risks to ensure a safer driving environment so let's dive into it now let's see the vulnerabilities in vehicles electronic Network equipped with Adas system modern smart cars function as distributed systems containing numerous electronic control units also known as the ECU that communicate through a standard protocol known as the controller area network also known as the canvas so this communication framework is fundamental to the operation of Adas systems however the canvas protocol has some critical security weaknesses for example it it lacks protection against traffic sniffing and message spoofing making it vulnerable to cyber attacks this means the attackers could potentially intercept and manipulate communication between ECU ging access to control essential functions of the car so some potential attacks are vehicle steering manipulation and acceleration overrides for instance the EC that is responsible for steering in motor driven power steering unit is one of the attack vectors in modern cars there are two systems one is the Smart parking assist system and the other one is the lane keeping assist system when it comes to Lane keeping assist system it can operate at any speed however the smart parking assist system is disabled to operate at a speed of more than 10 km/

hour uh the attackers can bypass this limitation like speed restrictions in uh smart parking assist system by intercepting and altering data packets so these um these are few vulnerabilities uh when it comes to ad systems as we uh move uh we'll be we'll be seeing more vulnerabilities that are present in Adas and the mitigation steps for it as well today I'm presenting a crucial study on enhancing the security of Advanced Driver resistance systems or Adas in modern vehicles as cars become more connected and automated they are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks This research tackles a vital question how can we detect and prevent malicious attempts to compromise vehicle safety features the researchers have developed the message time series intution detection system or MTS IDs this system is based on a key principle under normal conditions messages within a vehicle headers follow predictable patterns when an attacker injects malicious commands these patterns are disrupted allowing for intrustion detection what makes this approach unique in its Simplicity and adaptability the MTS IDs can be implemented with just a connection to the vehicle's internal Network without requiring Hardware modifications or protocol changes it is designed to work across various Network architectures making it versatile for different vehicle models the system was tested in real world conditions on two critical Adas features the lane entering system and the Adaptive CR control attacks were simulated by injecting malicious messages at various rates with different payloads the results were impressive for the lane centering system the MTS IDs achieved 98.4% precision and 98.92% recall for adaptive cruise control it reached 99.05% precision and 98.73% recall these high scores demonstrate the systems Effectiveness in distinguishing with normal operation and attacks however the researchers acknowledge some challenges very infrequent messages or sophisticated single message attacks might be harder to detect presenting areas for future research in conclusion while no system is 100% secure This research significantly advances the protection of AAS and autonomous vehicles from cyber attacks by enhancing the resence of these critical systems we are not just improving vehicle security we are contributing to the safety of everyone the road thank you today I'm going to present on the role of driver assistance system in enhancing road safety and reducing accidents this system represent a key advancement in vehicle technology aimed at improving road safety and reducing accident through the use of Cutting Edge technology advanced D assistance systems are integral to Modern Vehicle Safety leveraging Cutting Edge technology to mitigate accidents and enhance driver decision making this system such as adaptive cruise control and intelligent speed assistance demonstrates significant potential in reducing Road crashes injuries and fatalities thus contributing to overall Road Safety among the various addas analyzed systems focused on obstacle detection and automatic breaking specifically Advanced emergency breaking and forward Collision warning exhibit the greatest capacity to prevent accidents by preventing forward collisions this system could substantially lower crash and fatality rates by 2040 in addition to General Road Safety Adas also play a critical role in protecting vulnerable Road users particularly pedestrians and cyclist who are often more susceptible to traffic related injuries and fatalities however some adders face limitation in accurately detecting such vulnerable Road uses particularly in complex environments which can reduce their effectiveness improvements in detection technologies will be essential to address these challenges and fully unlock the potential of addas road infrastructure improvements can further enhance Adas performance clear Lane markings and digital speed limit singage air examples of infrastructure elements that support the effectiveness of system like Lane keeping assist and intelligent speed assistance maximizing their potential to improve safety finally the success of addas also hinges on educating drivers about the proper use racing awareness about both the benefits and limitations of this system is critical to ensuring drivers use them correctly and safely thus maximizing their impact on road safety this analysis underscores the transformative potential of adders in reducing Road accidents and fatalities while highlighting the need for for continued advancements in both technology and infrastructure to fully realize these benefits thank you um this paper presents a comprehensive data security framework for autonomous vehicles emphasizing adaptive
