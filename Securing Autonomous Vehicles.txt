hello and welcome to this presentation for insc 6680 this is the group doing the project on securing autonomous vehicles a comprehensive study of physical vulnerabilities so getting started with the presentation the motivation for actually doing this project came from two companies that have now been in the news more and more those being Tesla and whim so for AO it is a company that provides autonomous Robo taxis in cities across the United States and Tesla of course is the manufacturer of electric vehicles uh what's interesting to knowe however is that the day I'm recording this which is uh October 10th 2024 uh today is uh a Tesla event in which we think they're going to announce a robo Taxi of themselves so a fully autonomous Tesla vehicle that can pick up and drive people without a human driver and this is coming from Tesla which is a very large manufacturer of electric vehicles it's going to be very interesting to see where it goes so if we look at Tesla now in a bit more detail in 2021 they had an interesting transition from how they approach their autonomous Driving Systems uh they they announced something called Tesla vision and what Tesla Vision did is that it removed radar from their Tesla Road cars and this is a quote from them in 2021 they said that these vehicles now rely on Tesla Vision our camerab based autopilot system so it's it's going to be very interesting to note that Tesla's approach to full self driving is that it relies heavily on cameras rather than additional sensors like radar or lar which are used by many other autonomous vehicle developers which we're going to see soon like weo and in January 2024 Tesla released an update to their FSD full self-driving uh models and in this uh beta version 12.1.2 they said that full self-driving beta version 12 upgrades the city street driving stack to a single endtoend neural network trained on millions of video clips presumably sent by Tesla drivers replacing over 300,000 lines of explicit C++ code so even the approach that Tesla is not currently taking for their for their full self-driving models has changed from uh lines of code for every single decision that can be made to a neural network so it's going to be very interesting to look at the security implications of going from this approach of explicit code to the other looking at wayo now uh before getting into the details I just want to play this uh video here that I've embedded into the presentation let's take a look

so in this video we can see a wh car that seems to have crashed into a bus in San Francisco uh so it's interesting to note that the wayo cards already seem to be getting into accidents and into trouble before any threat actors or hackers have actually touch the cars so if already these cars are quite fragile it's going to be interesting to see uh how security is going to take a role in these full self-driving uh Vehicles so just a bit of context on whmo it is a robo taxi service company right now it's primarily in San Francisco but they are rolling it out in other cities across the US uh right now they're using these Jaguar cars that they're modifying and putting their sensors on it but they did announce that they want to build their own wh more branded purpose-built vehicles uh in the future and for way mode they took a different approach in which they instead of Tesla which only uses the cameras in their Tesla Vision system they instead used the 13 cameras but also four lar and six Radars so a different approach to Tesla they're using more sensors on their vehicle so it's going to be interesting to see the comparison between uh these two systems and the security implications of course and finally for weo very similar to uh to Tesla there has to be a computer actually making these decisions since there is no human driver so this is a quote from them they said that their cars are backed by 20 million miles of real world Driving Experience to enhance its autonomous driving system so as we can see maybe in this video it didn't really work that well but uh nonetheless it's going to be interesting to look at the security implications of these uh autonomous Driving Systems now what's interesting to note is that while we were using the name of weo uh weo is actually or used to be a the Google full self-driving project that they were working on and they rebranded it to weo and put it as a subsidiary now of Google and spun it off as its own project uh but weo is still uh considered part of Google and now if we look at uh our actual project itself and specifically the physical vulnerabilities that exist uh for this project uh we split it into two parts the sensors and the car control so we took this approach uh as we saw in the vehicles uh the two primary areas is the sensors that are going to be feeding information to the car and then the systems that are actually controlling the cars so that's going to be the uh things like steering acceleration and braking so if we look now at just at sensors uh we can look at sensor data anomalies so feeding incorrect information to these sensors we can look at GPS location spoofing so so making the car think it's somewhere it's not and the sensor spoofing attacks so on purpose sending information to these sensors uh that is incorrect uh in hopes of making the car do something it's not supposed to do and if we look at it now through the lens of car control uh this is the models actually that are going to make the decisions to drive the car we can look at it through the lens of the deep learning visual classification models adversarial test set generation so actually just generating uh incorrect or onp purpose uh training these machine learning models with incorrect data and then uploading it to the car because we wanted to do something that's not supposed to and the Deep neural network perception models uh that we saw that were used on the the Tesla cars now so how can we use these uh to our advantage uh to take a control of the vehicle and what's very interesting about this project is that we as let's say we are threat actors we do actually have physical access to the cars since weo is a robo taxi and now Tesla announced their own or they're going to announce soon their own Robo taxi service uh to get access to the car all we need to do is order one of them and then us as a threat actor we do have physical access to the car so if there is a a port or a uh something that they've used on the car which has not been secured uh we as threat actors do have access to that so it's going to be interesting to see uh how we can use that as well and if we look now specifically at the division of work we we are a team of five uh for this project and we've kind of identified three areas uh to focus on for the project the first is that we're going to split the work between those different key areas that I mentioned uh the second of course is that we're going to contribute our own writing research and ideas and the third is that we're going to incorporate relevant findings and insights into the report uh and to support us in doing this uh I put the link here on the slide uh this is just the link where we can get access to the it e sub description as Concordia students so we can actually go and get access to the research papers so this is just to show where we're going to be getting the information from primarily it's going to be from uh research papers uh from it e and other Publishers so if we look at specifically now the research papers that we're going to use this is just an overview of some of the papers that we found that uh fit well under the general category so for example this first one here ATT tax on self-driving cars and their counter measures a survey the second would be A current survey and future research challenges and the third would be a review of attacks and mitigation strategies so these three here they're good for general overviews of the attacks that exist not going into the details yet but just to get an understanding of what academics are saying about autonomous vehicles uh a survey of what currently exists just to have a better understanding of uh what currently exists and to put this as kind of an introduction to our project uh before going into the specific details of some of the attacks we're going to mention uh so for one of them for example for the sensors we have a research paper for GPS location spoofing for these autonomous vehicles another one for uh malware attacks for them in smart cities so this is when the car is actually driving and then potential sources of sensored data anomalies for those autonomous vehicles so research papers do exist for this we're going to leverage them for sure in our project and this is just an overview of some of them we found but of course in the uh project we're going to use more this is just some of the highlights that we've already found uh just by doing some research on on on itle E and looking now for car control so we found one for deep neuron Network perception models and robust autonomous Driving Systems another one for autonomous Driving Systems through adversarial test set generation and finally robust physical world attacks on deep learning phys IAL visual classifications so uh this is just some of the research papers we found specifically for uh the car control uh the things that are going to be making the decisions for the car and actually controlling it uh uh to drive so this is again just an overview of some of the papers we found but of course in the in the actual report we're going to be using more this is just some of the few interesting highlights we found and uh there seems to be a lot of research uh and talking about this already and I think in the future sure it's going to become even larger as we see more and more of these cars uh on the road so that's all I had for this presentation uh thank you very much uh for your time thank you for listening and yeah this is the conclusion for the group doing the project on the autonomous Driving Systems uh thank you very much
