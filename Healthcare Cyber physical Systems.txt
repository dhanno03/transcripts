hi my name is [ __ ] Sinha I'm going to present our project the title of our project is Healthcare sa physical systems and their physical issues this is a group project for our course Inc 6680 the name of my other group members are shown in the screen so let's first start with cyber physical systems so what are cyber physical systems cyber physical system is a concept where there are mainly two parts one is the Cyber part and another is the physical part part so together uh the communication between these uh two parts cyber and physical part uh builds the Cyber physical systems where different modern sensors and different equipments they actually uh comply the uh constitute the physical component or physical part of the system and there is also the Computing Network and different Technologies and different control units uh processors involved which part actually represents the Cyber part so by the Cyber part a lot of important decisions were made and uh controlled environment or controlled output was maintained uh through the physical part of the system so these are the Cyber physical systems there are a lot of applications of these cyber physical systems available currently and the important concept of Industry 4.0 is based on the Cyber physical systems where actually every important aspect or every important application of modern uh era is actually consists of cyber physical systems so this is this is a very important uh important basis uh for different development development of different important applications involving smart manufacturing Healthcare smart building infrastructure Smart City smart greed everything important and uh valuable infrastructure or services that are uh currently available in modern era actually uh are the part of the Cyber physical systems so in our project we actually uh focus on the application of cyop physical systems in the healthcare sector now I'm going to discuss a little bit more about the concept of the cyop physical systems in cyop physical system as I mentioned there are physical components uh involved which actually uh which actually GA gather information from the environment these are called the sensors or small sensors or the hardware devices which actually collect important information from the environment and they send it to the control units or the computation units this control units what they do with the data they can store this data or based on this data they decide whether which kind of steps or which kind of um changes can be uh should be done to the environment to maintain uh desired level or desired output so what these control and computation units do they communicate with the sensors and the actuators now actuators are the actual devices or Hardwares who are responsible to change the environment and to set the uh required level uh or required output uh in our system so this can be done by the control units uh through the communication networks that exist between this virtual space and uh the intelligence unit and the physical space and the intelligence units there are also data storage systems available in this system and the important part is the human machine interface through this human machine interface a user may input what kind of Ard values he wants uh to the control unit and it also inputs uh different data through the sensors so the human machine interface is an important aspect of the CPS there is also security mechanisms involved in the CPS because without security these systems can malfunction and they can uh they can they can they can give or input a wrong data to the system and based on those wrong data um uh uh proper control cannot be managed or maintained uh in the Cyber physical system there is also control algorithm control algorithms involved inside the control units so overall this is uh the concept of the cyop physical system now uh I'm going to discuss about the health care application of healthare uh and with the with the help of cyber physical systems lot of different sensors and medical equipments are available which actually use uh for the diagnosis purpose of a patient like temperature sensor EEG sensor ECG sensor and MRI these are the these are the healthcare devices which actually collects uh Vital Information from patient and sends it to the control unit um through the control unit this data can be processed and represented to a healthcare personnel and showing this data the healthcare personal can decide whether which kind of uh medical procedures can be done uh to the patients so uh we can imagine this is a very important uh important application where Precision is very much important and where reliability uh is a very um required uh characteristics without reliability uh without reliability this healthare uh the application of cyber physical system in healthcare it it will collapse uh so this is the this is this is the most important section uh application section of cyber physical system so um yeah this is uh this is the overall scenario of Healthcare in cyber physical system I will uh I will explain more about this so we can consider a patient which uh who who is uh who is used as a as a test subject and on the patient there are a lot of sensors attached these sensors send data to the control unit in the control unit inside of the control unit there is algorithms running and there is a data storage uh facility is also available and um there are set values assigned in the control unit based on those based on that set value comparing with the incoming data the control unit decides what kind of uh what kind of decisions what kind of actions should be done uh with the with the patient so that decision is conveyed to the actuator through the network and the actuators uh then it will it will correct the envir M or correct the um required adjustments to the patient's body so this is U this is how the Cyber physical systems work um in this is one kind of this is a simple scenario that I represent here the actual scenario is much more complex because the Healthcare System only not small sensors are used there are lot of complex mechanisms or complex um Hardware equipments are there like MRI like there are Auto IC or robotic uh surgical instruments uh those actually require a lot more attention and lot more accuracy to do to deal with the patients so that there are a lot of challenges involved in integrating cyop physical systems in health care the one of the most important challenge is the constant monitoring and the communication uh part so uh patient should be monitored all the time lot of sensors are connected to the patient and they sends actually life data to the control unit and if this is not accurate or there are one there are several issues or physical issues whether there are cyber issues were involved then not the control unit will not get the updated information from the sensors and that can lead to the uh critical injury or maybe the death of the patient so these uh kind of challenges should be addressed properly and uh and uh and in our project we are going to uh we going to Deep dive into this and find try to find more uh more concerning issues related to this uh application Healthcare application of cyber physical systems so uh at this point uh we have we have collected uh some key issues from our literature review like the reliability issue so devices May malale function and breakdowns in critical operations theaters may be involved uh with the with the with the critical critical devices so this is one of the aspect there is also power supply issues battery may be depleted in small sensors power is a very important issue and there is also lack of charging infrastructure in in rural areas or where there are there are not U established power supplies are available there is also environmental interferences because the small devices use uh use electricity and communicate with each other wirelessly so there should be proper electromagnetic interference uh resistance or protection should be involved uh in deploying this kind of devices there is also maintenance and wear and Care degradation of the physical components can occur uh for every very long term if these small devices are used or sensors are used then degradation may occur so proper uh proper take uh uh proper and periodic um periodic adjustments or uh Sur ing should be done to these physical components so these are the some important issues that we find so far there are also some security challenges in healthcare uh CPS we can categorize security challenges in two parts one is the physical security and another is the cyber security issues in physical security unauthorized access to devices is very much harmful because if an adversary or a bad person can get access to the physical devices it can harm serious uh it can do serious harm to the patient and it can also uh temper the medical equipment and which can be critical in different scenarios like automatic robotic uh systems which are involved in in uh in surgical issues there are also cyber security issues like hacking or D data breaches most of the healthcare data they are very much a vital information regarding a patient or a or a citizen of of a country so if a if if different hackers can get access to the medical data that are stored in local servers or in Cloud then that will lead to Serious uh personal uh personal information violation problem so this kind of uh cyber security issues can happen and we have to take proper control and proper uh steps to uh counter them at this point uh with our literature review we we we get some ideas about uh approaches to address this kind of physical issues they are uh reliability and resilience resilience issues so regular maintenance and calibration of the devices should be done properly so that these small sensors and critical medical equipments uh work properly because uh this is very much related to the health of a patient or even the life of a patient so the reliability and resilience is a very much important issue uh in this factor in this case there are also environmental control uh which should be which should be monitored properly sealing devices uh from electromagnetic interferences and ensuring hospitals have sufficient power supplies or backup uh supplies for uh critical medical procedures is uh important approach to uh address the environmental issues of uh cop physical systems there are also um uh frequent check on the on the established established Hardware network uh in a in a in a medical facility mandatory testing and certification of the medical devices is a important part I think um it is it is the it is the one of the most important factor that can ensure the proper Health Service in um in the in the medical establishments like Hospitals and Clinics so these are the approaches uh that we can take to address the physical issues involved with the uh cyop physical systems so uh in a summary the goal of our project will be to study the healthcare cyber physical system properly find out what are the inherent characteristics and the important components of cyber physical system Healthcare cyber physical systems and also to point out what are the physical issues regarding the Cyber physical system I mentioned some of the physical issues right now but we have to dig deeper uh and there are a lot of physical issues involved with with Healthcare CPS and uh we'll try to correlate between cyber physical issues physical issues with the cyber security issues uh see that what kind of uh connections were there with the physical issues and the cyber security issues and what uh kind of security measures we can take to counter this uh these physical issues and the cyber security issues both and uh we will also discuss about the possible approaches to counter the effects of the physical issues so this is uh these are the goals of our project and uh the references we go through so far are shown in uh in this screen and uh thank you very much uh for hearing our presentation goodbye
