hi I'm sna Roshan and today I'm going to talk about physical security of financial institutions so these all are my group members presentation we will be explaining about the introduction importance and components of physical security along with internal security and emergency preparedness along with some

challenges security and financial institute ions is extremely important when we think about Bank security we often focus on keeping hackers out of our systems which is cyber security but there's another part of security which is called as the physical security physical security is all about protecting the banks building the money inside and the people working there from Real World dangers this includes using things like security guards surveillance cameras and vaults and alarm systems as well to keep everything safe the goal of physical security isn't just to stop robberies it's also about protecting the bank from other threats like vandalism natural disasters such as floods or fires by having strong physical security Banks can contribute running smoothly keep their assets safe and make sure their customers feel secure we will be looking into import of physical security in financial institutions now let's talk about potential threats Banks face and why they need physical security to protect themselves the first thing is protection from theft and robbery this is one of the biggest threat to financial institutions Banks hold a lot of money so they are attractive targets for robbers thieves might try to break into the building or steal from ATMs to prevent this Banks use things like strong walls alarm systems surveillance cameras Etc the second thing is vandalism which is another threat this is when people damage bank's property like breaking windows and damaging ATMs terrorism is one more serious threat because many terrorist groups May attack Banks to cause fear or disrupt the economy finally there's the threat of natural disasters floods fires or earthquakes can Bank can damage bank's buildings and their systems if A bank's building is destroyed it can prevent customers from accessing their money to handle this banks have have imp implemented the disaster recovery plans and use things like fireproof saves to protect important items uh following slides will be explained by my groupmate we are going to talk about Access Control Systems in financial institutions they are critical for enduring Security in financial institutions by restricting access to sensitive areas such as walls it rooms and Executive offices key methods include key cards pins and biometric access each with his own advantages and challenges key cards are customizable and easy to manage but can be lost or cloned PIN codes are convenient but Su uh to being shared or observed biometric systems offer high security but raise privacy concerns and involve higher installation cost in addition V Management Systems track and control external access ensuring accountability and compliance with legal requirements combining these Technologies create a comprehensive security

framework and monitoring systems are vital for the physical security of financial institutions helping to detect detail and respond to potential threats CCTV cameras provide essential coverage of critical areas both inside and outside the premises with Advanced features like HD qual night vision and AI analytics enhancing security security Personnel monitor realtime footage Patrol the site and respond to breaches alarm systems including intrusion detection fire environmental and panic alarms add layers of production and can integrate with other systems for automated lockdowns together these Technologies ensure a comprehensive responsive security framework

preter security is a first line of defense for financial institutions preventing unauthorized access and protecting key areas like walls and enams it includes measures such as fencing barriers and gates to control the movement of people and vehicles Bots and vehicle barriers protect against vehicle based threats these systems are integrated with surveillance and access control for enhanced security together there they ensure the safety of assets and

Personnel internal security it is also the important thing which is required for uh ensuring everything is secure inside the bank and the financial institutions and uh coming to the uh components of the internal security where we go through walls and safe which is requir to store uh dollars and also the assets which are been mortgaged by the customers and also the asset documents which are required for the functioning of the bank and coming to the environmental conditions fire extinguishers should be installed uh wherever it is required and also air conditioning and other uh heaters which are required for the environment should be placed inside the bank for convenience and uh better operation of both employee and the customers so employee training and awareness is nothing but where the training should be provided for the employees based on how to handle the physical security of the banks like no tailgating and all this stuff coming to security policy and compliance is nothing but like the set of procedures that should be followed and stick to the street guidelines where security can be provided with

uh complaints coming to Unified security platforms which is nothing but integrating physical security as a part of cyber security where we can find the attacks like theft vandalism and uh robbery mergency preparedness which is nothing but uh the financial institution should be prepared for any emergency that might happen to the institution uh like uh uh force dentry uh uring the security personnels are available all the time at the ATMs and also as well as the banks so which which comes under uh physical systems uh physical security infrastructure where the night vision cameras might also required because robbery might happen overnight as well coming to the evacuation plan and DRS in the in the event of emergency or any fire exiss the fire safety plan should be uh good and uh effective to evacuate the place as soon as possible and uh to reduce the casualties uh coordination with local authorities like if any incident happened inside the bank should be notified to the nearby police station and the fire exion to take and also the ambulance to take uh crisp action and reduce the casualties coming to Alarm Monitoring system is Services it is nothing but to make sure alarm is uh good done running at all the time and so periodic uh assessment of the Alarm Monitoring systems is required so coming to employee and customer safety protocols where the rules and regulations should be in place for both the employees and the customers to be followed at the banks or any financial institutions to keep the process smooth and going

good coming to challenge faced by Banks or financial institutions uh there is a large volumes of security footage uh which are stored in significant resources uh with uh privacy regulations uh comes under data management uh there are also third party dependencies where some banks rely on external vendors for maintenance and any delays or INE inefficiencies from these vendors can impact overall security uh sometimes there also can be equipment malfunctions uh uh due to the ve and tear of the uh extremely used ones and softare bugs and unexplainable external factors uh people who may not also follow the certain protocols uh which comes under improper use uh uh also including these there are certain challenges such as cost maintenance uh and humor errors and uh resource intensiveness also uh are faced by the financial institution which we can further elaborate and uh talk about in the other present the coming presentation conclusion robus physical security measures are essential for financial institutions due to the sensitive assets their Safeguard and their suceptibility to criminal threats key strategies like Access Control surveillance and emergency briess are vital to protecting both assets and people however challenges such as equipment malfunction data handling and dependence on third party providers must be addressed to ensure consistent security by embracing Advanced Technologies and foring collaboration with law enforcement financial institutions can enhance a security poster ensuring long-term protection with regulations we used for our
