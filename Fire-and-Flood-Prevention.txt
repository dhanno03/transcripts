hello this is the first presentation for insc 6680 system physical security course and our topic is fire and flight

prevention these are the team members myself Aya Narayan Evan Vinson diini liita and Yuka

pradini introduction flooding is a frequent natural disaster that poses significant risks to urban and rural areas as discussed in various papers the integration of cyber physical system that is CPS has emerged as a transformative approach to flood prevention and management these systems use realtime data collector from sensors to monitor water levels and predict flooding events by leveraging iot technology and smart monitoring CPS can manage Water Resources more efficiently minimizing damage and providing timely warnings to prevent flooding Urban flood resilience Frameworks emphasize the need for adaptive planning and incorporates both engineering and socioecological resilience ensuring not just the ability to resist floods but also to recover and adapt to challenging

conditions fire prevention systems have advanced significantly with the integration of iot artificial intelligence and machine learning iot based fire prevention systems such as those for kitchen fires deploy sensors to detect high temperatures gas leaks and Flames these systems can automatically shut off gas supplies alert residents via alarms and mobile notifications and allow remote monitoring machine learning algorithms are being applied to detect fire hazards early and prevent ignition especially in scenarios like unattended cooking which is a leading cause for household fires additionally smart buildings equipped with iot sensors offers realtime monitoring and Hazard detction enhancing overall safety and reducing fire risk so both flood and Fire Prevention strategies increasingly increas ly rely on iot and CPS creating Smart Systems that ensure timely intervention risk reduction and improved Management in both urban and rural

settings so these are the scope of the papers we refer flood prevention and management the scope of papers focusing on flood prevention addresses both urban and rural Water Management challenges key areas include integ ation of cyber physical system CPS in monitoring and managing water levels and the use of iot to predict and prevent flooding the papers emphasize the need for for a holistic approach to flood resilience combining engineering ecological and socioecological resilience Frameworks to create adaptive flood Management Systems these systems not only resist and prevent flood but also enable rapid recovery and adaptation to changing envirment m al conditions the second one is fire prevention and detection fire prevention papers cover a wide range of topics including the use of iot sensors machine learning algorithms and building information modeling that is Bim in detecting and preventing fire hazards in both residential and Industrial settings these Technologies are employed for early fire detection automatic response such as gas cut off in kitchens and improving evacuation and disaster relief efforts through realtime monitoring and alerts the scope also extends to Smart building context where iot sensors are used to monitor fire risk and enhance safety technological integration across both flood and Fire Prevention themes there is a strong emphasis on the role of Smart Technologies such as iot wireless sensor networks and machine learning in providing realtime data facilitating early intervention and enabling more efficient management of disaster situations the papers collectively examine the challenges and benefits of integrating these Technologies in disaster prevention Frameworks with particular attention to their applications in smart cities buildings and disaster

environment object of the papers flood resilience and Management Systems the first one is to establish adaptive Frameworks for urban flood resilience that integrate engineering and social eological resilience for better flood risk management the second one is to explore the use of iot and Smart Technologies in creating robust flood production and response mechanism that can mitigate the impact of floods in both urban and rural areas the next one is to design and evaluate cyber physical systems that can monitor predict and manage Water Resources efficiently to prevent flood for fire detection and prevention systems the first one is to develop iot based fire prevention system capable of detecting fire hazards in real time particularly in high risk areas such as kitchens and Industrial settings to enhance fire Disaster Response through the use of B IM and smart monitoring systems that optimize evacuation routes and provide realtime updates to both occupants and emergency responders the next is to create machine learning models that can accurately predict and prevent fire ignition by analyzing sensor data and applying Advanced algorithms for fire detection the papers aim to advance the field of disaster prevention by integrating modern Technologies such as iot AI mCP s into practical applications they contribute to the ongoing effort to make cities and infrastructure safer more resilient and better prepared to handle environmental hazards such as flood and Fire by providing a comprehensive framework for using smart Tech Technologies in disaster management these papers offer valuable insights into both current capabilities and future directions for research and development in the field I'm liita I will go ahead with the literature review now let's focus on fire prevention first line of defense is the use of smart sensors through iot these sensors can detect early fire indicators like abnormal heat or gas leaks and send out alerts well before the fire escalates it's like having an intelligent ever watching guard monitoring for dangers machine learning further helps by analyzing sensor data predict the risk instead of waiting for alarms we're aiming to stop fires from happening in the first place it's a pro active approach and it's making fire prevention more efficient in case of an actual fire BM systems provide realtime building data to help emergency teams make better decisions such as optimizing evacuation Zs When people's safety is on the line knowing the quickest and safest Escape Route make all the difference moving on to flood prevention CPS plays a crucial role in monitoring and managing realtime water data it tracks every thing from water levels to weather patterns giving us the ability to react quickly to Rising flood risks resence based flood management is another important strategy it's not only about stopping floods but also ensuring that communities can recover swiftly afterward this resilience reduces the long-term damage and prepares us for better future floods with the help of machine learning we can predict floods more accurately by analyzing in historical data and weather forecasts this gives us a significant Head Start in preparing and responding minimizing the impact on lives and infrastructure let's talk about the exciting combination of iot cyber physical systems and Smart Technologies in Fire and flood prevention iot plays a critical role by using connected devices like sensors to gather realtime data about potential hazards whether it's rising temperatures in ating a fire or water levels signaling a flood this instant data allows us to react quickly to minimize risks but we won't stop at data collection machine learning enhances this process by analyzing patterns from the data helping us predict disasters before they occur imagine being alerted about a flood ours in advance thanks to predictive algorithms additionally BM gives us a detailed digital representation of buildings helping fire management teams make quick informed decisions during emergencies with BM you have a 3D map of a building that tracks fire spread which allows for efficient resource allocation in response so to sum it all up the combination of iot CPS and machine learning is transforming both fire and flood prevention these Technologies are enabling us to act proactively rather than just reacting to disasters whether it's using smart sensors for fire detection predictive modeling for floods we now have the tools to reduce risk and save Life by integrating all these systems from BM for fire management to resence based strategies for floods we are creating safer and smarter environments going forward we'll be exploring more research papers to find the best methods for fire and flood prevention we'll be comparing different approaches analyzing their pros and cons and focusing on how they are designed and implemented our aim is to identify the most practical and effective solutions by conducting this comparison we hope to suggest the most suitable approach for preventing both fire and flood disasters ensuring safety and resilience thank you
