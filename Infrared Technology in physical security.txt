hello my name is Oda and I'm here to present the presentation on behalf of my team my name is uh yeah so before okay so welcome everybody today I'll be exploring the topic infrar technology and physical security this presentation prepared by our group will delve into how INF technology has uh revolutionized physical security measured will be measures uh we will discuss its application in excess control and intrusion detection and surveillance systems and how it contributes to enhancing Security in high-risk environments second slide before dividing into the infr technology let's first understand what's physical security is so physical security involves protecting physical assets physical assets facilities and Personnel from unauthorized this can include measures like surveillance access control and parameters defenses technology play a crucial role in physical security by enhancing detection capabilities reducing response response times and ultimately increase overall safety given the complexities of modern security threats it's essential to integrate Advanced Technologies like infrared to stay ahead Okay so so in the slide three we're going to talk about the importance of physical security so the physical security is crucial in preventing theft vandalism and unauthorized access in sensitive areas such as airports military base and uh data centers ensuring physical security is vital for safeguarding people and valuable assets with increasing risks and need of constant vigilance there is a growing demand for advanced security solution the use of infrar infrared technology for example provides robust capabilities to detect and prevent security breaches more effectively than traditional methods slide four we're going to talk about overview of infrared technology let's now explore yeah infrared infrared technology itself infrared or we can say IR is the part of electromagnetic spectrum and is invisible to the human eye it's broadly categorized into three parts it's near IR mid ir and F far IR each defined by its wavelength near IR has shorter wavelength while far IR covers longer wavelengths when applied in security systems infrared technology or IR excels in detecting heat and movements which makes it particularly effective for applications where visuals observation along alone is insufficient it is a key tool for providing a reliable detection in various environments slide five types of infrared sensors infrared sensors comes in two main categories passive infrared P sensors and active infrared sensors P sensors uh detect heat emitted from living being livings living beings like humans and animals without emitting radiations themselves making them suitable for energy effect uh energy efficient motion detection emitting radiations themselves making them suitable for energy effect uh energy efficient motion detection active ined sensors on the other hand emit IR beams and detect objects when these beams are interrupted they are often used in Intruder alarms and barrier systems to detect unauthorized entry emitting radiations themselves X we're going to talk about the advantages of infrared sensors and security infrared sensors offers a severe distinct advantages in security settings they are reliable even in low light conditions performing effectively in complete darkness additionally infrared detection is invisible to the naked eye make it difficult for intruders to detect and by bypass these systems finally passive IR sensors consume minimal energy making them a suitable and coste effective solution for large scale security implications implementation for B these attributes make in these attributes make infrared technology an attractive choice for a variety of security security needs slide seven we're going to talk about applications of infrared and and intrusion detection one of the Premier one of the primary uses of infnet technology is an intrusion detection system that is IDs infrared sensors help

detection I'm sorry infrared sensors help detect unauthorized movement in restricted areas for parameter security infrared sensors and cameras can monitor and secure the boundaries of sensitive areas like military installation or industrial complexes since IR systems are effective both during the day and at night they provide round thee clock security coverage this constants monitoring reduces the likelihood of undetected intrusions and help maintain a high level of security slide eight we're going to talk about applications of infrared in surveillance system infrared Technologies is also used extensively in surveillance systems infrared enabled cameras provide uh cameras provide clear images even in low or no light conditions making them ideal for night vision applications this capability allows security Personnel to monitor premises without the need of visible lighting reducing power consumption and minimizing visibility of the surveillance setup moreover IR cameras can trigger realtime alerts when suspicious activities are detected ensuring that security Personnel can respond quickly to potential threats Slide N infrared in Access Control Systems IR technology enhances Access Control Systems by enabling touchless operations IR sensors can detect the presence of individuals or vehicles at the entry point like automated gates and doors this technology provides a safer and more hygienic way to manage access to secure areas for instance in a high in high traffic facilities like hospitals or airports the contactless operations not only improves convenience but also reduce the risk of contamination so here is the case study and that is infr technology in high security facilities to see how infrared technology is implemented let's look at some uh high security facilities in airport and critical infrastructure IR cameras are used to monitor restricted areas and direct unauthorized accesses military bases on the other hand uses IR sensors to enhance perimeter security and ensure 24/7 monitoring of sensitive zones data centers Implement higher intrusion detection systems to uh to secure entry points yeah secure entry points and sensitive areas ensuring that only unauthorized personel have access here are some challenges and consideration in is security although infared technology is powerful there are certain challenges to consider environmental factors like Fog rain or extreme weather weather can affect IR sensor

accuracy additionally false alarms can be triggered by pet Wildlife or sudden temperature changes the cost of implementing Advanced a technology such as thermal cameras can also be prohibitive these challenges must be addressed through proper planning and integration of compl compliment Technologies so so the conclusion of part one is here in conclusion infared technology is a crucial component of modern physical security systems it's reliable energy efficient and effective in various conditions making it a versatile tool for enhancing Security in the next part of the presentation we will cover and we will cover the advanced application of I technology and explore future trends that will shape its evolution in security systems thank you for your attention I hope this presentation has provided the valuable insight into the role of infrared technology and physical security I look forward to your questions and feedback thank you so much
