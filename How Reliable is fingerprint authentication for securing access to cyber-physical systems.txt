this will be our progress report uh presentation and we will start with our topic which is how reliable is fingerprint authentication for securing access to cyber physical systems so we will start with a general project overview uh and our objective will be an investigation about the reliability of fingerprint authentication uh systems in cyber physical systems with an emphasis on security performance and practical issues um in we will divide the project in five sections the first of which will be the introduction where we will go over CPS and the role of fingerprint authentication and then we will continue with a literature review and uh our goal in this section will be to uh in essence examine prior research on fingerprint system dependability then we will do our case study review where we will take a look at um some real word examples best practices and Industry challenges uh that they currently face and then we will wrap up with our expected results and discussion where based on the findings on the literature and the case studies will will provide recommendations for future and further research of of Our Own in the conclusion we'll summarize our findings and set this areas for further

study now moving into the details about the introduction um in general what we plan to do is present um some key points uh starting with the Cyber physical system and these are the systems that combine physical and computational processes and rely more heavily on safe access restrictions then we will um introduce fingerprint authentication where we will examine the strengths and limitations of fingerprint authentication often used to secure Accents in a CPS uh in a cyber physical system then we will present our research focus and um this will be where we uh discuss the question of our project which which is har reliable is fingerprint authentication for securing access to a cyber physical system and we will present our intentions which is to focus on issues related to environmental effects or fingerprint systems sensor weaknesses false positives and negatives Etc and what we plan to do in this section is to explain the scope of our report and the significance of evaluating reliability in the context of our uh project

goals in the next section uh we will do our literature review where um we intend to review academic papers and research articles that investigate fingerprint authentication and specifically its reliability in uh uh cyber physical system settings um there we will present our uh references and our sources and in general we will focus in the following areas uh which will be the strength and challenges where we will look at the research showing benefits of fingeret authentication as well as the specific reliability uh that it encounters which can be for example environmental influences false positives or negatives and things like that then we will um present some sensor vulnerabilities where we will want to concentrate on Research in sensor weaknesses which could be spoofing attacks performance deterioration Etc and then we'll will also uh try to do some comparisons with other biometric methods um with the goal of where the goal will be to do an investigation on how fingerprint authentication compares to other biometric methods in cyber physical systems for example uh one comp comparison can be done with facial uh recognition in general what we plan to do in this section is to gain a strong grasp of the present status of um fingerprint authentication reliability uh and this will help us with our case studies and assessments in the next section but also to um help us make our own recommendations for future work following the literature review we will start our case study review where uh we will find real world applications brocher from products uh maintenance guidelines best practice guides for fingerprint systems in areas like banking border control health care and uh other similar um domains uh these will be real world applications from um for example companies that are active in the uh the field and things like that uh we will focus in general in three categories will be the first one will be as I said the real world implementations where we intend to examine customer success stories real world applications uh in which the fingerprint authentication uh systems were employed in uh the scope of a cyber physical system and then we will also try to lay out and present the industry guidelines and suggestions for maintenance uh for the devices themselves but also best practices in general and uh um how you can influence reliability by following these uh procedures and we will also uh try to include some vulnerabilities that have been observed and um try to incorporate some uh specific scientific papers that we uh want to find and some case studies that look more closely into how fingerprint systems can be compromised in real life scenarios in general what we plan to do in this section is to examine existing cases uh for real world implementations and this will help us better understand how fingerprint systems operate in actual practice and what factors influence their reliability

in the expected results section uh what we will do is based on our literature review and Analysis and our case study findings uh we'll will combine these um aiming to propose some future case studies that could provide insights into the unique difficulties the that fingerprint reliability in uh cyare physical system environment might um uh have problems with we will focus on uh the reliability of fingerprint sensors difficulties in industrial or outdoor situations um and how they um react in their environment with restrictions like moisture and dust and we will also try to discuss some potential enhancements and Alternatives like hybrid biometric Technologies uh that may be able to fix some of these issues uh for future work we expect to find and identify some areas for uh further exploration which could be for example long-term sensor reliability or the use of several Biometrics to improve over security and in general what we plan to do in this section of the expected results is um to use it to propose what a future study could uh or should focus on to improve uh the reliability of fingerprint authentication in uh cyber physical systems but also try to describe potential resarch

directions to summarize what we plan to do is to investigate important issues and limitations to fingerprint authentication in uh cyber physical system contexts using both current literature but also real world case studies uh we plan to talk about environmental V variables device maintenance best practices on how to capture fingerprints and images and the over uh reliability of these uh systems for closing uh we will go through some steps for uh future research um trying to suggest areas for uh any future research that might follow um primarily focusing on testing fingerprint systems under challenging situations um whatever that might be depending on our findings and in general investigating hybrid biometric Solutions as well so uh that could be another uh point and uh proving to be more robust or more uh reliable and we will close off with some final thoughts and try to Showcase and present our understanding or fingerprint authentication in these days the reliability it has in cyber physical systems but also try to provide some future uh research areas and try to address constraints and whatever else we might

discover thank you and uh have a great day
