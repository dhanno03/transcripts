hi everyone we here with our first group project presentation for insc 6680 system physical security we're presenting it to Professor Mosen gurri and our group member names are listed here on the first Slide the project topic is security concerns in air traffic

control the contents are as follows we'll talk about introduction of ATC and then security needs of the same vulnerabilities and security attacks in them along with attack detection methods and finally we'll conclude and list the references we know that a air traffic control or ATC is a service provided by groundbased controllers it directs aircrafts both on the ground and within the controlled airspace ATC can also offer advisory services to aircraft operating in non-controlled airspace modern ATC Technologies include secondary surveillance radar SSR and automatic dependent surveillance broadcast adsp moving on let's take a brief look at why secure air traffic control systems are essential to the aviation industry firstly the aviation industry has undergone significant growth over the past Century evolving from small scale air travel to a massive Global Network the growing demand for air travel and increasing complexity of air Space Management calls for efficient modern Air Traffic Control Systems to ensure safety and efficiency secondly alongside the growth of traditional air traffic the skies have now seen the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs used for everything from commercial delivery services to military operations drones are adding a new layer of complexity to airspace management integrating uavs into civilian airspace presents unique safety and Regulatory challenges that modern ATC systems must address ensuring a safe coexistence of manned and unmanned flights lastly the air traffic industry has transformed dramatically with advancements in satellite navigation Automation and realtime data sharing new technologies like automated dependent surveillance broadcast or adsb now allow for more precise and efficient airspace management however these advancements also introduce new vulnerabilities such as cyber security risks and the need for increased personal training to manage Advanced systems the complexity of the modern air traffic environment makes constant innovation in ATC the need of the

arm before we dive into understanding how we can enhance the security of Air Traffic Control Systems let's take a look at how ATC work in traditional radar based ATC system the primary radar sends out signal which bounce back when they hit an object like an aircraft allowing the system to calculate the aircraft's position the most important components of this system include a primary surveillance radar which detects aircrafts based on reflected signals and a secondary surveillance radar which interacts with an aircraft transponder to get more detailed information like altitude and identification however these systems have security limitations such as lack of encryption limited coverage and vulnerability to spoofing and physical attacks this highlights the needs for more secure air traffic control Technologies moving on this slide introduces automatic dependent surveillance broadcast or adsb which offers a major improvement over traditional systems unlik radar which relies on groundbased system to detect air aircraft adsb uses GPS to broadcast and aircrafts position directly to ground stations other aircraft and satellites providing realtime tracking this eliminates the need for Active groundbased Radar interrogation and allows for more precise continuous updates the security benefits of adsb include Global coverage realtime data transmission enhance situational awareness and reduce Reliance on ground infrastructure this system significantly improves track tracking accuracy and safety making it crucial part of modern air traffic management now talking about the vulnerabilities in ATC in this section first of all the modern threat model is based on increased digitization and automation Aviation is increasingly using unauthenticated digital communication which makes attacks easier to ex execute and harder to detect particularly on automated Systems Technology capabilities are making Wireless attacks accessible to a broad audience with minimal Financial barriers and accessibility of Aviation knowledge through media like forums websites and captured communication data makes it easy for attackers to disrupt the aviation sector now we have two types of attackers of Outsider threats and Insider threats Outsider threats are based on groundbased attacks using software defined radios injection alteration or jamming signals and inside of threats they impersonate legitimate participant and crowd sourcing systems and inject false data into the

network now next we have the vulnerabilities so here the disconnect between AV and cyber Security Experts is a concern there is an increase in attack surface with uh air traffic density growing and complexity in air traffic is growing because of the nextg uh technologies that we are using in aircrafts and uh here the internet-based information systems increase vulnerability uh surface now in adsb we rely on broadcasting nature which makes it prone to cyber attacks like spoofing jamming flooding and data injection datalink communication concerns like controllers they face risk of failures or cyber attacks and there is lack of robustness in ATC systems which may be vulnerable to Accidental data Corruptions and Signal jamming as

well knock coming to security attacks first let us discuss about Wireless attack vectors against ATC first one is injection of ghost aircraft which disrupts situation awareness and overwhelms ATC as fake airplanes created with possible transponder signals modification of label changes identity altitude or velocity of legitimate aircrafts radar disruptions are causing as uh jamming frequencies used in

ATC security attacks interference in VHF within ATC is possible as it disables VHF by chaming it and cpdlc security attacks are possible as is easy to use drop spoof or alter messages which eventually leads to impersonate ATC unit primary surveillance radar systems are vulnerable to time based attacks whereas secondary Sur surance radar is vulnerable to amplification attacks attackers can even inject Fake adsb Messages by jamming its messages and sending change data which creates displaces in its position in ATC attack detection methods crowdsourced attack detection methods in Open Sky Network Open Sky network is basically a global crowdsourced system which consists of both registered and anous sens which is used to improve ATC security C Source attach detection methods these are the four methods first one is possibility checks which validates received data such as position speed altitude next is cross cross referencing data which Compares data from multiple sensors in the same area third one is multilateration which verific verifies aircraft location by using three or more sensors fourth is statistical IC analysis it detects anomalies in Signal arrival times with statistical tests next is handling attacks in open Skype jaming injection modification are Outsider attacks whereas single sensor data manipulation Cil attacks are insided attacks This Is How They responded to attack DET detection first is unreliable aircraft tracks are flagged for inspection and abnormal messages are removed from radar displays and if there is enough receiver data is available attack Source will be pinpointed and these are the things we will be working for the future first one is detailed research on the attack surface of ATC components and we'll be discussing about existing threats in ATC with mitigation strategies and details security analysis of tax on adsp conclusion and references now let us conclude this PP in summary uh Aviation is evolving with new technologies like uavs and satellite based navigation so securing ATC is very critical and vulnerabilities in systems uh suspectable to makes it suspectable to attacks like GPS scooping jamming and Signal injection to improve more security and defend against internal and external threats the industry must use cyber security and strengthen it by adopting robust Monitoring Solutions and Implement stronger authentication protocols these are the references we used for this project thank you
