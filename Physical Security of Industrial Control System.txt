hello today I'm going to present on the topic physical security of industrial Control Systems our group has five members those are miir nikun janish abishek and bavia this is the outline of our presentation today uh we'll cover what is industrial Control Systems uh the relationship between it OT and IC why is physical security critical for IC we see the key areas in ic physical security and at last we'll see our project and goals first what is Operation technology it refers to the hardware and software that monitors and control physical devices process and events within organization few characteristics of OT are that it focuses on Direct interaction with machinery and industrial equipment and it also ensures the operational process at are efficient safe and reliable uh for comparing it with it it deals with data processing and information systems and for the OT it just just concerned with the physical operation and processes now let's see what's the relation between it OT and IC uh it is used to manage data networking and information systems and on the other hand OT controls physical processes and machinery and when we combine both it and OT it enhance efficiency but at the same time it will introduce new security challenges uh what's the role of IC uh it is Al it is a subset of OT IC relies on both it and OT for operation and communication uh great example is Cara system that uses it networks for transmit data from OT devices security implications the bending of the blending of it and OT environments increases the attack surface uh protecting ICS requires addressing both Cipher and physical security threats but we'll see the physical security and why is it important physical security involves the protection of personal Hardware software Network and data from physical actions and events that could cause damage or loss there are three key components for physical security first is in deterence measure and it can involve fencing signage security lighting second is detection measures and it involves surveillance cameras motion sensors alarms third is response measures it deals with security personal exess control and incident response plans now why is physical security is so important uh it can prevent unauthorized access to critical systems and Facilities uh it can protect against theft vandalism natural disaster and terrorism and it also ensures the safety and continuity of

operations now we'll see what is industrial Control Systems uh those are integrated hardware and software systems designed to monitor control and automatic industrial process they are essential for ensuring the efficiency reliability and safety of industrial operations there are three key components for IC the first is SCA it is used to remotely Monitor and control for processes over large areas second is DCs that is distributed Control Systems it is used to control production systems within a single location and third is PLC that is programmable logic controllers it is used for automation of machinery and Industrial processes now there are few industries that uses IC those are water treatment oil and gas manufacturing transportation and

energy why is physical security critical for industrial control systems uh for protecting critical infrastructures Isis control essential services like power water and transportation and those are very critical for now physical Brides can lead to operational distributions and safety hazards threats specific to IC are unauthorized access where a physical tempering with Control Systems occurs second is sabotage where an intentional damage of equipment or facilities occurs third is the theft of equipment where a stealing of Hardware containing sensitive configuration would happen few consequences for the poor physical security could be it can have operational downtime and financial loss also it can have a safety risk to personal and the public and the last is it can compromise the sensitive data and control systems

now we'll see the major key areas in ic physical security physical security ICS encompasses several critical areas and it must be addressed to ensure comprehensive protection the major kees are Access Control surveillance and monitoring environmental controls parameter security and Insider threat first we'll start with Access Control Access Control mechanism that regulate who can enter or use resources in physical space some methods used for Access Controller authentication systems and authorization levels for the authentication systems we can use key cards Biometrics PIN codes and for the authorization level we can assign permission based on rules the few challenges for Access Control are it can manage access for employees contractors and visitors and could be difficult second is preventing otherise entry due to lost or stolen credential is a critical

part so next is surveillance and monitoring the purpose of this is to detect and record unauthorized activities or Brides tools used for surveillance and monitoring are CCTV cameras that is used for continuous visual monitoring then we can use motion sensors that can detect movement in restricted areas and also we can use alarm systems and it is used to Alert security Personnel to potential threats the challenges for surveillance and monitoring are it can be used to monitoring remote or unman facilities and also it can ensure realtime response to detect

incidents next is environmental controls the purpose of enal control is to protect equipment and Facilities from enval hazards the systems that use anomal control or climate control uh it is used to regulate temperature and humidity and fire oppression the systems to detect and extinguish fires and for the flood protection we can use that to measure prevent uh from water damages and the challenges for en contr are maintaining optimal condition for sensitive equipments and the Second Challenge is it could be a rapid response to environmental

emergencies next is parameter security purpose of it is to secure the outer boundaries of facilities to prevent unauthorized entry there are three measures for parameter Security First is physical barriers for that we can use fences walls and Gates uh next is access points and for that we can secure entrance with guards or access controls thir is detection system for that we can use motion detectors and intrusion alarms the challenges for parameter Securities are that for protecting large or remote premises could be a very difficult task then detecting a responding to bridge in real time could be a great issue next is Insider threat uh it is a risk posed by individuals within organization who might exploit excess for malicious purpose there are two types of Insider threats first is malicious Insider whose intention is to harm due to disgruntlement or bribery second are those who are negligent insiders those are unintentional harm due to lack of awareness or mistakes to mitigate these threats we can check do a background check where we evaluate employees before granting access we can access monitor like logging and reviewing exess activities and we can do training programs where we educate staff on security protocols to prevent from inside of

TRS for this project of study on physical security in ICS we have explored the following topics and those are accessing physical security viabilities in remote ICS facilities and we'll see the integration of physical and cyber security strategies in ic we'll also look at impact of emerging Technologies on IC physical security and how to mitigate insided threat in industrial control environment we will also see the Regulatory Compliance where we analyze regulation and enhance physical security then we're going to see designing physical security audit framework for IC and supply chain security risk and also the protecting against hybrid threats these are topics that we are going to dive into for the future research our aim for this project is to provide a holistic view that offers comprehensive analysis of physical security challenges in ICS then to conduct a detailed study that dives deep into each Focus area to identify vulnerabilities and solutions and we'll conclude our findings of our Research into acable insights and recommendations the outcome of our project could be a comprehensive report where we present our analysis finding and proposed strategies then we can give you the enhanced security practices which is contributing to improve physical security in ICS environments and lastly we can create a foundation for future research by establishing a groundwork for ongoing advancement in ICS security thank you
