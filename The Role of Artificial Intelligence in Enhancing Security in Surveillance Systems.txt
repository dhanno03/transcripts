hello everyone and Welcome to our presentation today and today we have a very interesting topic to talk about and our topic is the role of artificial intelligence in enhancing Security in servance systems and we have five members in our group and we are cheron an Elvis olimi and Me Myself tassin all right at the very beginning I would like to give you an overview of AI in surveillance systems and we're going to divide this into three different parts and one of them is Introduction to surveillance systems well it's 2024 and we can still see some traditional systems rely on human operators for monitoring and Analysis also we can see increasing demand for more advanced and autonomous security systems which increase efficiency and reduce the cost now let's talk about the role of AI in modern surveillance artificial intelligence or AI enhances the capabilities of surveillance by automating analysis AI driven systems improve efficiency accuracy and response times compared to traditional methods now let's talk about key AI Technologies that's used at the very beginning we have machine learning for pattern recognition we also have computer vision for for realtime video analysis and also we have very popular deep learning algorithms for detecting unusual behavior now let's talk about how AI enhances Security in surveillance uh at the very beginning I would like to talk about automated tra detection AI powered system can detect anomalies for example suspicious Behavior unauthorized exess in real time also it reduces Reliance on human operators which reduces errors minimizing error rates and delayed responses now let's talk about facial recognition and biometric analysis well our Advanced AI techniques for identifying individuals based on facial features also it used to detect known threats or restricted

areas now let's talk about predictive security a can predict potential security breaches by analyzing historical data or the data which happened before proactive approach to preventing incidents by doing this we can increase the amount of security and we can increase the safety as well real time alerts and incident reporting well AI systems generate automatic alerts for security teams enabling faster responses which is going to be very hard if this is operated by

human okay for this slide we're going to talk about growth of AI in surveillance systems let's look at global market growth the AI powered surveillance Market is proi to have grow from 4.9 billion in 2022 to 14.9 billion by 2028 also if you look at the crime reduction impact cities that have implemented AI power surveillance reported to have a 20% decrease in crime rates also AI based predictive policing uh reduced response time by 25% in urban areas increased adaptation well 60% of Public Safety organization have adopted AI Power servance Systems as of 2023 also over 30% of smart City projects worldwide are implementing aib based surveillance system

Technologies also it is very efficient if you look efficient improvements we will see AI surveillance systems reduce human operator workload up to 75% and also up to 95% accuracy in trade dediction through AI driven facial recognition and behavior analysis let's have a look to the growth in real time video analysis which is very very important by 2025 90% of video data will be analyzed in real time up to 10% in 2020 and obviously it's all happening because of AI there are some references if you want you can have a

look we can already see AI is growing every single day and it's also getting better and it's helping people all around the world increasing Safety and Security AI has revolutionized surveillance systems by introducing Advanced Technologies that enhance security capabilities if you look at the overview the key that Technologies use in more surveillance in the very beginning we will see computer vision and image recognition well this technology will allow machines to see and interpret visual data this technology finds applications in task such as identifying objects enhancing image quality and understanding complex scenes now let's talk about facial recognition systems most of us already have this kind of feature on our phone a controversial yet very very powerful technology operate by dting faces extracting unique features and matching them against the existing database if you look at Behavior Analysis and anal detection well this technology is aimed at understanding and predicting human behavior and identify unusual action or pattern that may signal potential threads finally if we look at object detection and tracking well this technology will allow you to identify and follow objects of interest in real time are crucial for monitoring large areas are tracking suspects across multiple cameras however these systems face challenges in handling occlusions crowed scenes and varied lighting col

conditions for the next slides Elvis will help us to understand about this topic thank you all right now we're going to looking at some of the benefits of AI in surveillance AI is revolutionizing surveillance is turning passive video feeds into active security measures with real time analysis and proactive monitoring Imaging systems that tirelessly monitor video data 24/7 spots TR threats or unusual activities without the fatigue that can burden human oversight take for instance in a large retail setting AI can simultaneously track hundreds of camera feet importing suspicious Behavior like shoplifting or unauthorized entry one standard feature of AI in surveillance is facial recognition which can identify individuals even in crowded or dimly environment this is crucial for minimal investigations and posting security efforts but the magic of AI doesn't just stop at the tral security it makes waves in finance with real time for detection in health care with safeguarding perent wellbeing and it also protect Wildlife from PES in essence AI is enhancing security by making it more accurate responsive and predictive while also promoting us to carefully consider the ethical application surrounding privacy now we to look at some of the challenges that are in AI for surveillance the AI has enable surveillance which brings numerous advantages but it also faces significant challenges that must be addressed a critical issue is biased as AI systems can perpetrate discrimination if trade on flawed or unrepresented data this leads to unfair treatment of certain groups AI might also struggle to predict new evolving threat because it algorithm rely on historical patterns leaving potential security gaps for unprecedented risks the system can be insecure and vulnerable to attack ta like data poisoning or modal Invasion compromising both Effectiveness and privacy integrating AI with older Legacy surveillance system is also another obstacle that must be addressed as outdated technology can hinder seamless adoption additionally real time monitoring of high resolution video feeds require substantial computational power which limit AI adoption in resource constract settings now we let look at some of the ethical consideration of AI as we delve into the AI enable surveillance we must confront the significant ethical applications of these Advanced Technologies privacy is a major concern since AI systems can gather and analyze vast amount of personal data without individual consent this raises questions about balancing security with personal privacy the potential for bias and discrimination is another critical issue where flaw data can result in off targeting of specific demographic groups reinforcing social inequalities accountability is also crucial it's unclear who bear responsibility when AI systems make mistakes like misidentifying the suspect there's a risk of mission CRI where tools originally designed for safety could be used for invasive monitoring such as tracking potential desent transparency is essential as AI systems often operate as black boxes making their decision making process difficult to scrutinize lastly we must consider the long-term social impact such as the potential for self-censorship in a constantly monitored environment to ensure the ethical use of this powerful systems now we're going to look at some of the case studies and real life applications of AI one of the most illustrative and controversial examples of AI enabl surveillance is China's extensive facial recognition system this sophisticated network of AI powered cameras span Urban centers transation hubs and R regions creating an unmatched surveillance infrastructure at its core this technology leverages facial recognition to identify individuals in real time by comparing their faces against extensive images database allowing authorities to swiftly locate Persons of Interest while this system has proven effective for law enforcement purposes such as tracking down fugitives and finding mission missing persons it is also deeply integrated with China social CR system which monitors citizen Behavior to rule plance in cities like Beijing and Shanghai individuals are captured on camera hundreds of times daily with AI analyzes not just their identity also their behaviors and emotional states despite claims of enhanced Public Safety the system raises significant concern about privacy freedom of expression and potential discrimination this example underscores the critical need for ethical guidelines and safeguards as we consider adopting similar Technologies in other parts of the world another example of case study is with Amazon go so with Amazon go it was launched in 2018 and it showcases how AI power surveillance can enhance your reto experience these Innovative stores utilize sensors computer vision and AI algorithm to monitor customer movement and track the items pick up creating a seamless shopping experience without the need for cashiers this system automatically adds items to a customer virtual card and charges them when they leave and elating the need for checkout lines and making shopping more convenient and efficient Beyond convenience AI also plays a role in loss prevention by detecting suspicious Behavior or potential theft real time monitoring reduces the need for manual oversight thereby improving stores safety and oport to conclude AI has enhanced surveillance and it holds incredible potential to revolutionize security retail and various other sectors however it's vital to balance this advancement with ethical considerations as we adopt this technology we must ensure it responsible implementation protecting privacy and fairness while reping it benefits for a safer and more efficient future thank you
