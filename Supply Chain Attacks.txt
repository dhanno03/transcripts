hello hi my name is dsha and today we are going to discuss about supply chain attacks before I start with the slides I just want to mention that the definition of supply chain goes well beyond the flow of materials alone it includes the flow of information services and finances even if one considers a single Factory at a single location operating with just few suppliers the supply chain process is complicated operation that requires effective communication and a supportive organizational culture the supply chain forms the backbone of current consumer first world every commodity in the market moves through a sequence of stakeholders who engage in a sophisticated manner to deliver the final product let's start with our first

slide so in this slide we see a comparison between traditional and modern supply chain on the right side the traditional supply chain shows a linear process starting with the raw materials moving through suppliers manufacturing plants warehouses and Distributors before finally reaching to the consumers this system is often manual with limited real-time data sharing making it slower and less adaptable to the changes in demands or disruptions on the left side we have modern automated supply chain which uses Advanced Technologies like forecasting drones autonomous tracks and mobile integration data transparency allows realtime tracking and customers can reroute shipments Via mobile devices the system is more flexible and allowing for predictive shipments and drone deliveries improving efficiency and customer satisfaction so in summary while the traditional model is linear and slower the modern supply chain is dynamic and data driven leading to faster more responsive and efficient

operations on slide number second we Highlight Industries where supply chain security is essential supply chain security is crucial across various sectors to mitigate unique threats and ensure seamless operations in pharmaceutical sector safeguarding against cargo theft counter fitting and illegal diversion is essential to protect Healthcare and patient safety the agre agriculture food supply chain focuses on maintaining food safety and quality throughout its Journey safeguarding against contamination and fostering consumer trust similarly the software distribution chain emphasis emphasizes the Integrity of software the trustworthiness of suppliers and effective vulnerability management to prevent system compromises in spare part Logistics reliable And Timely Supply is critical for maintaining machinery functionality as shortages can significantly disrupt Industries the retail sector faces continuous pressure to innovate and adapt to Consumer demands while managing security challenges such as theft fraud and supply chain Integrity the oil and gas sector while it its significant impact on the supply continuity and geopolitical risk lastly in in the precious met industry handling high value Goods presents challenges like theft smuggling and counterfeit products underscoring the importance of secure supply chain for Market stability thus tailored security strategies are vital for each sector to address these unique threats and ensure safe supply chain operation slide number three is definition of a supply chain according to MIT attack frame work a supply chain attack involves manipulating products or their delivery mechanism before they reach consumers compromising data or systems these attacks can occur at any stage of the supply chain such as altering developer tools to introduce vulnerabilities compromising software development environments and tampering with code repositories additionally attackers May modify the soft uh the source code dependencies to in insert malicious code interfere with software update mechanisms and distribute infected systems images from the factory they can also swap legitimate software with malware versions or sell tampered products by intercepting shipments to introduce compromised items in a sense supply chain attacks Target various points of the lman to distribution posing significant security risk

next up we have cyber security threats in supply chain cyber security threats can Target any phase of supply chain with attackers often focusing on weakest link to access the entire system both hardware and software requires robust security but software is particularly vulnerable to remote attacks cyber security supply chain is crucial to protect it systems networks and software preventing data theft and malware major risks include intellectual property theft where leak of confidential information can harm businesses and sensitive data exposure where customer information like credit card details must be protected Cloud technology while improving efficiency introduces vulnerabilities increasing the risk of malicious attacks the unpredictability of cyber threats means that Contin comprehensive security measures are necessary up next my friend pram will explain an attack on supply chain named solar wind

which hi everyone uh this is prom today I will be talking about a significant threat in cyber security supply chain attack uh in particular we will dive into the solar wind attack one of the most high-profile incident in recent years uh so let's first talk about what is solar wind solar wind is an American it management company known for providing software to Monitor and manage Network system and it infrastructure one of their Flagship product was oron and this was the focal point of the solar wind supply chain attack uh this is the uh like solar wind attack in headlines um that moment when the attack was happens uh BBC and CNN trying to cover the attack uh so now I will uh briefly describe the solar white attack uh the attack began with recognized by the thre actor likely a nation state they identify vulnerabilities in solar wind software development and environment from their attackers gain unauthorized access to solar winds build environment injecting the sunbrust malware into the oron platform sour SCH and then um the attacker uh disguised uh the malware uh inside the uh legitimate code and blending simly into the solar wind development process as a result when solar wi signed their software and distributed it to the customer through the update they unly included this compromise code uh here in the slide I try to just little bit give some uh short brief uh and then uh once the compromise audence software was installed in by the customer the sbst malware became active and it opened a back door allowing attar to access the system of the organization that install the uh affected up did and uh then uh the malare uh was highly sophisticated and it remained uh Dom after installation avoiding the immediate detection by sending minimal traffic once the attacker gathered enough information they escalated their access and moving literally within the big Team Network to access sensitive data so the attack uh impact was uh totally high and now I will uh try to give you guys timeline of this uh attack uh the attack first happened in the September uh 2019 uh when the attacker uh first uh installed the solar windes um uh inside the solar wind software the attacker installed the malware and uh compromise update was released in March 2020 and it went undetected until fire I discover it in December 2020 the scale of the attack became public shortly after the the uh multiple agencies of the USA uh so here I give the details like uh timeline of the solar wind supply chain attack when it happens um and the lesson learned from the solar wind work like there were several key uh takeway we can take it uh from this solar R first the critical need to secure the software Supply CH second the importance of proactive detection measures third the role of the zero trust infrastructure in the mitigate r and finally the necessary of continuous monitoring and uh vulnerability management and uh what could be the solution in a future direction looking to the future we can improve security by implementing a software bill of materials or SBO uh to track the software component additionally uh AI can be used for anonymously detection and while blockchain can secure transaction tracing uh finally it's essential to strengthen the collaboration between the public and private sector to enhance the cyber security uh standard uh I will try to cover more in future uh I think in our final presentation we will cover everything thank thank you

everyone in this slide we have discussed about cyber physical system and cyber supply chain cyber physical system and cyber supply chain both the system are highly vulnerable to attack due to the growing complexity uh of cyber threat threads in this slide we have tried to show the mware flow in a system through the flow chart and unknown um an unnown uh malware has been installed with uh by uh alongside a software by a company when they install the software the malware is also inserted in the system and when the user update the software the mware get activates uh in the system through CSC and it uh it uh uh manipulate the system and for this reason uh it uh still sensitive information and uh cause uh serious effects uh ban belief network is used to mitigate these types of attacks in uh CSC and uh we have mentioned the uh process um by which briian believe network uh try to reduce the damage in this slide in the next slide we have described about onch randomization for memory protection uh which is dynamic Random Access Memory uh and D is widely used in consumer electronic such as computer smartphone and other devices for uh for data storage but a Dr is a volatile memory means it requires constant constant power connection to maintain the store data otherwise when the power is removed Dr loses the information it holds and Dr is easily get affected by these two type of attack one is cold boot attack and another is rammer attack in cold boot attack it exploits residual charge in D to recover sensitive data after power down and in rmer attack it exploits the physical property of uh Dr causing bit flees in adjacent roast so repeated excesses we have also described about the uh about the measure it can take to mitigate these uh two attacks for a cold Bo attacks first key uh first key rure is uh the process which can uh mitigate the damage and for uh rammer attack randomized memory addressing is a essential um prevention and we have also described how this will work and uh how this will help um the system to get attack

free hi I'm Aisha and I'll be talking about step net which is one of the most sophisticated cyber attacks when it comes to supply chain as it EXP for significant vulnerabilities in the supply chain specifically targeting the software systems that control critical Hardware infrastructure it was designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities by manipulating centrifuge operations we'll explore how it propagates and its impact on in the upcoming slides so to begin with suet was discovered in June 2010 and was found to be a malver specifically targeting Iran's nuclear enrichment facility as the pie chart illustrates it was able to infect over 60,000 computers globally with more than half of the infections occurring in Iran although St stet continued to spread through the internet its damaging power was reduced by the availability of antidot and a built-in expiration date of June 20 June 24th 2012 so let's dive deeper into how it operated the attack was carried out by spreading the worm through USB drives which bypass the air gap systems those not connected to the public internet this clever use of USB drives was critical because the targeted systems were highly isolated with no direct internet connection once it found its way onto a a computer it searched with Seaman uh industrial Control Systems running in Windows systems specifically used in Iran's nuclear facilities if the machine did not match the malare would remain dominant mean minimizing detection but when it found its Target it activated exploiting the for 4 day vulnerabilities previously known weaknesses which in software that allowed it to take control subance main ability was to Spy Control and Destroy without being detected first it monitored the operation of the centrifuges allowing it to understand the their function then stet began manipulating speed of centrifuges by altering the frequency of the electrical current powering the motors by alternating the speeding speed up and slowing down the centrifuges it was able to cause physical damage to the Machinery what made it more Insidious was that while the centrifuges were being sabotaged STX uh sent false data to the monitoring systems making it nearly impossible for uh operations to detect uh operators to detect the issue until it was too late so what makes snet so successful firstly it saved CA by leveraging proven effective code that had already been tested and it's a common strategy in cyber War additionally certain complex made it difficult to trace uh this delate ambiguity acts as a defense mechanism so so the so to give a recap it's basically the technical risk that was involved was exploitation of the IC and the scatter systems and it resulted in the compromise of critical infrastructure with potential physical damage so in conclusion Stu was wasn't just a onetime attack it paved weight for more sophisticated cyber attacks and uh we need to uh emphasize the urgent need for TI security protocols uh to prevent uh to protect against similar threats in the future thank you
