hello everyone take my warmest Welcome to our presentation different camera technology for physical security my name is Nadia and today I will be discussing about how camera technology is transforming physical security do you know that over 90% of security breach could be prevents with the right surveillance Tools in place in this presentation we will explore different type of camera and how they integrate with security system and the key benefit they offer so let's dive into it in our increasingly connected world the role of camera technology is critical it is not only enhance realtime monitoring and surveillance but also provide protection for people property and assets camera has involves to become a fundamental part of physical security system as you can see there are various types of camera technology that serve different purposes in security such as CCTV cameras which has been around for decades IP cameras which offer internet based surveillance distributed smart camera Network a system of interconnected cameras provide border coverage AI powered smart cameras which can automatically analyze photos and detect the anomalies there are many more all contributing to how we SA gate spaces advant features of modern security cameras take security to another level this includes high definition Imaging which provide Crystal Care visual making it easier to identify details then the motion detection which triggers alert when movement is detected ensuring no suspicious activity scores unnoticed facial recognization and increasingly valuable tool for identifying individuals and the artificial intelligence would enhance the ability to detect the tra and anomalies in real time by integrating these Technologies camera system to not only watch and record but proactively enhance security measures this Innovation ensures a safer environment for individual and valuable assets

camera technology is not just a stand alongside anymore it integrates seamlessly with border security systems camera are often linked with the access control like doors and GS working alongside sensor and alarms for adding protection they also synchronize with parameter monitoring and detection systems creating a robust security network that ensures continuous coverage with Advanced features like high definition Imaging motion detection and AI driven analytics camera system not only record photos but actively assist in deterence which discourage criminal activities simply by being visible evidence collection they provide critical photos for identifying suspects and supporting legal cases and issuing proactive alerts camera can send realtime alerts for immediate action when suspicious activities is detected in short modern camera systems are essential for preventing incidents and providing solid evidence when needed good day this is sanana fariel now let's take a closer look at the technology behind CCTV cameras and their evolving role in cyber physical security traditionally CCTV cameras have relied on analog signals for video transmission while these systems have been widely used they come with limitations especially in today's increasingly Digital World analog systems require dedicated cabling for connectivity and have limited integration with digital systems however there is a growing shift towards smart CCTV systems where cameras are integrated with the internet of things and computer vision Technologies and with this integration cameras can now provide realtime TR detection automatically analyzing video fits to identify suspicious activity without the need of any kind of human intervention and these systems can also contribute to infrastructure protection by monitoring critical areas and ensuring immediate automated responses to security

breaches despite their importance CCTV systems face several challenges physical tampering signal interference and unauthorized access are the most Common forms of attacks against CCTV cameras for instance cameras can be physically obstructed or damaged analog signals can be jammed and hackers may try to gain access to camera controls to counter these threats several Solutions are employed these include hardening physical security or tamper resistant housing for physical security encryption of video fits to prevent signal interference and multi-layer authentication for system access uh that includes passwords and biometric access to ensure that only authorized Personnel can control the cameras by enhancing the technology and addressing these vulnerabilities CCTV cameras can continue to play a critical role in safeguarding both infrastructure and

people hi this is Drew Patel now let us look at IP cameras for surveillance looking at the technology used these devices use Internet Protocol to facilitate seamless video and data transmission across networks this technology supports robust Wireless configurations allowing flexible deployment even in remote areas IP cameras can also be used with AI driven analytics for real-time object detection and behavior analysis now let's consider how these Innovations contribute to system physical security IP camera significantly enhance situational awareness by providing continuous and actionable realtime data this is critical for Effective thread detection they incorporate automated decision making capabilities that analyze video feeds using AI thus accelerating response times to incidents lastly IP cameras play a part in network security as well protecting our Vital infrastructures by combining cyber and physical defenses in a compliment manner now let us look at types of attacks possible on IP surveillance cameras for this we identify three primary vulnerabilities first the adversarial noise attack where attackers add noise to the digital feed manipulating the image's outcome and potential causing misclassifications by the system an example of this would be altering a stop sign to appear as a speed limit signed to the system creating dangerous misinterpretations the second type is patch and sticker based attacks yes the attacker physically Alters the environment by placing stickers or patches on objects this can deceive the smart camera's AI into misidentifying the objects which could lead to security breaches for example restricted areas could be mislabeled and go unprotected third type is device manipulation attacks where the attackers Target the camera's processing abilities directly which can also be done by firmware tampering to ignore or misinterpret certain objects within its field of view now moving to Solutions offered to tackle the digital manipulation from adverse attacks deploying secure network protocols is important utilizing a network protocol such as https TLS ensures that data transmitted between cameras and network is encrypted preventing unauthorized data interception and manipulation additionally D noising networks are employed prior to primary processing of the captured images these networks are designed to detect and reduce the attacks Focus to deceive the camera's AI thereby preserving the Integrity of data lastly it is essential to integrate robust object detection algorithms these algorithms are Advanced enough to differentiate between manipulated objects and their genuine counterparts ensuring that even sophisticated digital tempering does not compromise the system's accuracy

hello I'm surj ner and I'll be talking about distributed smart camera networks distributed smart camera networks consist of individual smart camera nodes that communicate with a central control center these cameras include sensing processing and communication capabilities and are often part of Wireless cyber physical surveillance systems enabling Dynamic and real-time monitoring a key Fe feature is their data Fusion models which integrate information from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and make informed decisions this distributed system allows for continuous round the-clock surveillance reducing the risk of systemwide failures by processing the data locally by using cryptographic techniques the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data are maintained enhancing overall physical security

distributed smart camera networks face several types of attacks denial of service attacks aim to overload the system impacting its performance replay attacks involve intercepting and replaying old video data whilst false alarm attacks are triggered by environmental noise or faulty sensors increasing the systems workload to counter these rests we Implement spread Spectrum techniques to scatter communication signals making jamming attacks more difficult redundant nodes ensure the system remains operational even if some cameras are compromised we also use strong endtoend encryption like aes256 to protect video data and employee data anonymization to safeguard individual identities with clear policies on data retention and deletion
