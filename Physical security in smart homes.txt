hello everyone our project is physical security in Smart Homes introduction to Smart Homes nowadays all smart devices in our homes are integrated with iot for seamless communication and control this communication allows us to control devices in homes remotely via smartphones or voice assistants some smart devices in our homes optimizes energy and uh reduces cost the smart locks cameras and sensors enhances the security overall smart home is a convenience for daily

tasks advanced technology integration in Smart Homes a systems will try on users or habits will personalize surroundings like lightning temperature and security integration of SM smart grids enables realtime energy management and demand response ecosystems expands smart home connectivity to external devices and services such as health monitoring and Smart City infrastructure why activated systems enhances integration with the natural language processing the typical Smart Home Smart devices look like this components in Smart Homes security cameras provide realtime monitoring central control hubs manages and connction all smart home devices and smart lightning allows remote control scheduling and dimming of Lights motion sensors detect movement to trigger alarms lights or cameras temperature and humidity sensors controls the temperature smart locks offer keyless entry interconnectedness this is a key feature in Smart Homes creates a unified system can be managed through single app or platform uh smart hubs like uh Google next and Amazon Alexa can be as act as an Central system to control multiple devices with a single command Cloud systems enables a remote control and monitoring from anywhere via smartphones protocols and standards smart devices uses protocols like Wi-Fi JP and Jet waves or Bluetooth for communication between devices in this slide we will discuss about the importance of physical security in smart homes there are the protection of critical devices preventing unauthorized AIS safeguarding personal data physical tampering ensuring system integration preventing sabotage of Safety Systems protection against sensors poofing or tempering detering physical breakages or protecting against emerging threats physical security threats in Smart Homes as Smart Homes relies on interconnected devices the that can control uh aspects of household these systems become vulnerable to various physical threats such as tampering the attacker May manipulate the smart locks or security cameras to bypass them this can leads to unauthorized axis and unauthorized axis Intruders May force entry or bypass the hardware of smart locks this can result in gaining direct physical access two Smart Homes or system controllers device stft the smart devices like cameras or security security control hubs can be stolen uh this disrupts the smart home security network and monitoring capabilities the power power supply tampering attackers can cut or disrupt our two smart devices this renders them inoperable this creates security blank spots dos attack the physical dos attack involves cutting of the power or network cables this disrupt the communication between devises and control

hubs this slide explains an ultrasonic based in audable attack on voice controllable system the attacker generates a voice command modulates it on an ultrasonic frequency and transmits it using a trans user towards the smart locks microphone the locks microphone demodulates the signal processes the command and unlocks the door without making any audible noise leaving the user unaware of the

bridge this analysis identifies two major risks which are disabling security systems and unlocking smart locks disabling security systems posess the highest risk with the high probability of leaving the home vulnerable to theft or intrusion unlocking smart locks through ultrasonic commands also presents a high risk though with a moderate probability leading to unauthorized axis and potential harm this picture describes about the defense mechanisms against ultrasonic based inaudible voice attacks in Smart Homes it highlights the use of ultrasound monitoring to detect suspicious frequencies and a demodulation process to identify and alert against the malicious voice commands the watch do system processes signals through frequency acquisition and noise analysis to trigger alarms if an attack is

detected sticker based attacks involved placing printed adversor patches or stickers on objects like stop signs or product packagings to cause camera BAS system to misclassify them the attacker manipulates the systems recognization process leading to to potential safety risks particularly in environments like autonomous vehicles or security infrastructure these attacks require medium preparation effort but are relatively easy to execute once the patch is placed the impact is high as misclassifications can result in Road accidents or security breaches despite the preparation these attacks have a significant impact on critical

systems light manipulation attacks involves using projectors or lasers to emit advisor light patterns onto the objects altering their appearence in a camera feed this discomposure misleads the systems recognization causing it in to misclassify or fail to detect objects of the people while the probability of this attack is low due to the need for precise equipment and control lighting conditions the impact is high such attacks can significantly alter how security systems perceive the environment leading to critical misjudgments especially in safety sensitive applications like surveillance or the autonomous

systems adversive clothing attacks involves wearing specially designed cloths embedded with adversive patterns that confuse camera based facial or object detection systems these patterns can prevent the system from detecting or correctly identifying the person allowing the attacker to bypass surveillance unnoticed the probability of such attacks is high as they are relatively easy to execute by simply wearing altered clothing the impact is medium with potential consequences for avoiding surveillance systems though they are less critical than attacks on the infrastructure these attacks are hard to detect making them particularly effective for secrecy purposes

for various attacks is determined by using formula Ral P into I where probability and impact are rated as low medium or high patch based attacks and adversive clothing attacks pose the highest risk both scoring six as they are relatively easy to execute and have a high potential to disrupt critical systems like autonomous vehicles or security infrastructure sticker based attacks score a risk of four with medium probability and impact indicate they are less critical but still POS significant risks in security sensitive environments light manipulation based attacks have the lowest risk score of three as they require precise conditions and Equipment making them less probable although their high impact on system performance can still lead to severe consequences if successful overall the most attention should be directed towards addressing patch based and adversive clothing attacks due to their higher RIS risk

levels the physical attacks for fingerprints there are two attacks for the fingerprint the first one is spoof attack and the second one is Reconstruction from initia template let's look at spoof attack the attacker lifts a residual fingerprint from any surface and then the attacker uses the lifted fingerprint to create a dummy finger with materials like Silicon and gelatin the dummy fingerprint is placed on the sensor of the target device the sensor reads the fake fingerprint and assumes it as a legitimate one it authenticates the fingerprint using the previously stored one thus the attacker gains the unauthorized access to the system or device now the Reconstruction of the minia template the attacker steals a database of minia templates these are the unique points in a fingerprint used for identification from a server or CL cloud storage using algorithms like amplitude and frequency modulated functions the attacker can reconstruct the full fingerprint image from the stolen minia templates a fake fingerprint is generated based on the reconstructed minia the attacker uses the F uses this fake fingerprint to bypass the fingerprint sensor the system authenticates the attacker as it pursues the fake fingerprint to be genuine the attacker gains access to the system without the legitimate users involvement in biometric security two major risks are spoof attacks and database hacking spoof attacks where fingerprints are lifted from surfaces like smartphones and recreated have a moderate to high probability due to the ease of fingerprint exposure the impact is significant as it can leads to unauthorized access to devices and secure areas making the overall risk High though the priority is slightly lower compared to other attacks in contrast hacking a minutia template from a biometric database has a moderate probability but a much higher impact as it can compromise security across multiple platforms this makes the risk high and priority the highest due to the potential large scale consequences integration of Smart Technologies improves convenience but provides new vulnerabilities highlighted risks include ultrasonic attacks adverse camera manipulation and fingerprint spoofing continuous monitoring encryption and proactive risk management are essential to ensure security ongoing Innovation and vigilance are required for future proof security measures we would include more attacks on different devices in the next presentation thank you
