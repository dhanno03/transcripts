greetings Professor I abov will be presenting our research topic risk assessment Frameworks for physical systems uh we chose this topic uh primarily because physical risk including uh fire natural disasters uh and even unauthorized access in terms of uh risk with uh in terms of six cyber security poses a significant threat to organizations across various Industries this risk uh if not properly managed can lead to substantial operational disruptions Financial losses and even harm to human life in many cases I myself have been a fand along with my other four team members including aush pavna AR and vinit worked on this uh project throughout and prepared this presentation so on this one we speak about uh the risk assessment framework for physical systems where we focus on the basic concept of risk assessment the idea is about identifying and analizing and evaluating potential hazards that could uh affect an organization's physical assets and operations We Begin by listing critical assets such as maybe building equipment or even staff and then we go on to identifying threats which are for the company or for the entity including natural disasters or even security breaches including physical and cyber security breaches and then we examine how what are the potential vulnerabilities in the system uh which could be exploited and uh the risk can be converted into something that happens over and then we develop strategies to mitigate them accordingly uh here we discuss how and what is the importance of uh comprehensive risk assessment as you can see on the screen so a comprehensive risk assessment uh minimizes potential losses and ensures Regulatory Compliance and maintainance over maintains uh operational continuity for example if I can give you an example in terms of uh maybe PCI DSS payment card industry uh data security standard right so that's some digital payments which protects uh data while you are paying over on a machine or a device now that is what pushes a lot of vendors to ensure compliance and allows you to have a risk assess I mean is part of a risk assessment uh similar to what we have maybe for uh like the Canadian Health we have FDA regulations which safeguards various medical equipment and patient safety so they have a lot of standards in regards to how you can uh treat your patients how you have your equipment sanitized and a lot of other things which uh I mean are included uh so once we kind of identify vulnerabilities early all this risk are prioritized based on impact uh ensuring efficient and resource allocation accordingly so you can uh give out resources uh based on these Frameworks and plan your strategy accordingly right how you would be assessing your risk uh so you can conclude everything inside and then you decide your strategy going ah so this proactive approach uh strengthens Industries including Healthcare Finance or Tech in in many ways and help them helps them stay compliant and resilient during disruptions uh as I mentioned the examples of pcidss or maybe the heal Canadian FDA these all are just examples of uh and are part of the comprehensive risk assessment uh framework when we Del delve into the types of risk here we categorize them into three small groups physical human related and technological the physical includ fire natural disasters earthquake in in a very simple way where we see maybe compromised Hardware from temperatures changes or even electromagnetic interference in some rare cases uh the human related risk involves theft maybe vandalism or social engineering attack which me being from the inscc as a very Prime attack Vector used uh in in case of Cyber attack which leads as a initial attack Vector for a lot of big cyber attacks and breaches that happen uh finally all these technological risk cover power outages equipment failures and cyber threats including dos or dos which is used a lot uh these days because it's very simple you just put in a script and you can conduct a d do that against maybe even the biggest banks in the world so it's used a lot lot these days each of these risk whether physical human or Tech related can have serious consequences if not managed properly right uh going ahead you see and try to understand uh the risk I mean we try to understand the risk assessment process uh we try to break down uh the process in in very simple steps where you see it starts with identifying the assets you need to protect the building so maybe you have a company named X which wants to protect uh it itself I mean and and H has to conduct a risk assessment so they would start with protecting the physical uh I mean INF that have including the equipments and the staff then we identify what are the threats uh maybe natural disasters that can happen if you are around the river flooding can be a serious risk if you are in a earthquake prun zone I think in that case you would want to have some measures uh against those earthquakes so you maybe plan out your construction ahead and and have a building that is earthquake proof in some way or maybe I mean accordingly you can take a lot of steps uh from the very previous stages of building the company as well so uh natural disasters accidents uh and I mean any any other malicious accidents as well that can be taken taken against the physical infrastructure we then look for vulnerabilities like lack of surveillance or inadequate security policies after assessing all these likelihoods and impact of this risk uh maybe using various Frameworks like is issp or if you're doing it in a in a context of uhbe card payments as I mentioned PCI DSS can be a good framework with you can use right so Hippa is again uh something that is used in us uh so all these can be used accordingly to kind of uh have your own identify the risk have do risk assessment and then strategize to kind of have uh mitigation Frameworks in place as well right so for example in this case we will have installing alarms and training staff accordingly as steps for this finally continuous monitoring ensures that these strategies remain effective over time so you would have uh maybe various quarterly checks into what your risk assessment uh where your risk assessment stands or maybe if you want to if you maybe after at two quarters or once in a year I mean this is something that can be repeated based on how the entity feels like moving ahead we see the risk ass assessment methodologies uh quite and simple and short u it's qualitative quantitative hybrid where you see qualitative having uh involving assigning risk factors to to each risk where you see high medium or low and then we determine what's the final risk in case of quantitative as the name suggest we need sufficient data uh based on that data you kind of calculate your risk uh so in in terms of security as I know you have slas you have Aros annual dat of urance and all those terms which can kind of help you uh prioritize as well into which risk are you preferring more which which has more in Impact over you conclude in in context of financial as well as operational capabilities so that is quanti quantitative and then we have hybrid which uses methods to assess risk that are difficult to quantify or quantify and then use quantitative methods on the rest so it is amongst the most used and uh accepted method because it kind of combines both of the above qualitative and quantitative methods for uh I mean assessment right uh going ahead we see how risk assessment and Frameworks uh H for physical systems are implemented in various sectors so various sectors have unique approaches as I mentioned right we have PCI DSS we have Hippa two different sectors two different Frameworks uh where in h i mean if if I give you an example where we in healthcare we see a focus on patient safety and compliance especially for organizations making a medical equipment or handling Healthcare data Hippa is one example for that in manufacturing companies uh maybe producing Electronics or food Focus uh I mean they focus on operational continuity and safety uh for example if you consider here in Canada in Montreal we see uh energy sector which includes companies like Hydra Quebec uh they emphasize on disaster preparedness and infrasture protection because uh we have seen blackouts in past years where uh a small incident can lead to a blackout which hinders a lot of uh operational I mean capacity of the city uh hinders economic activities and and overall it kind of uh does does a lot of damage to the city in terms of Economic and operational uh terms so in trans for example in transportation we see companies like Tessa Airbus bombarder who prioritize Safety and Security for both passengers and if you're doing cargo aircrafts as well each sector uses tailored uh Frameworks to address its uh specific risk as we

see uh so Professor we conducted and reviewed a paper on the ISP framework which integrates security safety and privacy into a single uh risk assessment method for medical devices so this framework employees tools like employees uh tools like the CVSs which is a short form for common vulnerability scoring system and the B basian theorem to evaluate risk uh quantitatively uh so in in in such Frameworks you ensure that organizations have secure medical devices and protect sensitive patient data effectively just to mention the authors we have tahim yakub Hadar Abbas who are senior members at i e and uh Narin shakat as well uh because the it was their paper which we reviewed and studied accordingly for this project uh for the overview of issp framework it integrates security safety and privacy assessments into a very unified good approach using multiple standards and regulatory requirements includes methods like the CVSs and the basian theorem which I already mentioned in the previous slide to evaluate risk uh in a quantitative way for example it meets regulatory uh requirements like those from the FDA Canada health or maybe in the U and even the iso the framework has been tested on specific medal medical devices such as infusion pumps to ensure uh compliance and safety accordingly so CVSs as I mentioned is a very common world vulnerability scoring system and it's a standardized framework to assess the sity of security vulnerabilities U so it is rated amongst from 0 to 10 where zero is none and as you go and increase the score 0.1 to 3.9 it is low 4 to 6.9 is medium 7 to 8.9 is high and then critical is 9 to 10 it uses various metrics to calculate the sity so once you have determined the city you rate the CFS CVSs score just to give a small brief into what base theorem is because we used it it helps assess the likelihood of security events by using prior prior knowledge and observed data it improves risk assessment by I mean refining predictions it detects anomalies and then enhance these all enhances all the decisions uh making process uh in areas like intrusion detection spam filtering and Mal detection this is all in context of the cyber security industry this method ensures a more accurate approach to identify and managing potential threats I mean so uh if you have a because we see a lot of uh Advanced firewall devices and intrusion detection systems and Mal detection all them all of them usually implement the base the assess the likelihood of all these security events that might happen by using the observed and prior prior knowledge and obviously they observed data that they store and have so the process uh in for the assessment uh involves identification of assets understanding various device functions and then the data itself and how it is handled uh after this we do threat identification which evaluates potential risk including malicious threats like maybe cyber attacks and non- malicious ones like using errors or equipment malfunction so it coners malice as well as non incom I mean incompetence in some way or the other uh then we do risk evaluation which involves identifying vulnerabilities maybe in software Hardware or operations analyzing various past issues like maybe FD recalls for a medicine for a device uh then you do risk determination which calculates the likelihood and impact of threats on patient safety privacy and device functionality creating a unified risk s so this is all in respect and is in amalgamation of the security as well as the health industry so it kind of serves both purpose for mitigation we see security control which are selected and implemented uh which cover both Technical and AD administrative including the physical measures uh this may include training staff integrating controls into device operations and a lot of other St other processes uh accordingly finally we Monitor and review uh we conduct a monitoring process and review them over time which ensures that the control remain effective and with regular updates as needed uh additionally there is a very importance which is given out to documentation of the entire process which is crucial for compliance and future risk assessment and additionally if an audit happens onto the entity it helps them as well so outcome involves uh as this framework improves your comp improves the compliance with maybe medical devices uh with regulatory standards like FDA and EU U as I mentioned it provides a very comprehensive risk assessment uh which helps uh even the hospitals the pharmacy companies in terms of healthcare as to ensure that the de that the devices they use are safe uh the patients are safe and all the sensitive patient data is predicted as well so in conclusion risk assessment is an ongoing critical process for ensuring that physical system remains resilient against a wide array of threats by continuously monitoring and adapting to emerging risk we can uh Safeguard operations maintain compliance and ultimately protect both assets and people that is the target uh I really thank you for your attention and uh I really appreciate the course work and uh the the opportunity to work on such projects uh going on to Future uh aspects of how what can be done we can expand the scope we can see which uh I mean technological advances can be incorporated into these Frameworks and then we can work on risk mitigation plans for those hypothetical scenarios this can be maybe uh the Doomsday scenario I mean to go to exaggerate maybe the AI taking over and all those it's it's far away as of now but just to exaggerate on those terms I mean that is the extent one can go up to in in such risk assessments uh we mentioned the references of the authors were referred to and I along with my teammates thank you for this opportunity oh
