hi good evening today I'm going to present safe guard safeguarding I devices physical security and protocols so there are my members and then first I'm going to explain about this picture like see what is iot uh we are surrounding by the iot devices as per IMM says concept of connecting any device to the internet and to the other devices that's the IID so like I is the Cyber when cyber secs the top priority for protecting data and networks the physical security of it devic is more important nowadays so like what is different between traditional iot it and iot so it is like interacting with the physical device more interactively then but iot cannot access and managed or monitor in the same way same way like iot IP and the other thing is it is so for different security and privacy and capabilities than traditional ID so like in iot there are two main architecture one is device Gateway Cloud DC and another is direct internet connections so direct G Cloud it's actually work like a mediatory and it helps to I device to connect with the physical device with the cloud device and here we actually using BL Bluetooth low energy authentication and paing protocol to connect the device with the physical device and the cloud device um here is the another architecture which is direct internet connection it's directly connect the device to the uh uh server without any intermediary Gateway or devices so but here the user have to more burden to connect with the device and they have to manage all the things directly to the Gateway and the server so there is no uh intermediary Gateway or anything okay so uh another uh protocol is actually authentication Access Control protocol uh what we can do actually Implement physical Access Control uh like biometric smart lck to the restrict area or actually who can access the hybrid devices and also we can Implement uh Mutual Authentication Protocol between ID devices before allowing data exchange and uh finally the environmental monitoring we can also do the environmental monitoring like we can use sensors to detect the environmental changes like any vibration temperature and that would actually uh lead to physical attack also we can Implement real time uh alerts that send abnormal physical activity uh of the uh near I devices okay uh now I'm going to talk about the physical security protocol for IP devices okay so uh what I can do we can actually use temper proofing device device deves uh which means actually use of Hardware seals to the meters so that if any temper happen it can be detected easily also detected mechanism that the system when physical tempering actually uh detected so another part is securing housing and deployment so what we can do actually we can uh set up the device in such a place secure place uh so that it is very hard to reach to the adventor is physical who actually targeted the physical assist iot systems uh in this slide I will talk about the importance of physical security in iot devices uh physical security is crucial nowaday because if the attacker has the access to physical security uh the cyber security can be also breach and so the attacker can ENT like attack the entire system uh such as attacker can temper the system it can be theft can be stolen or damages di Dev uh so the thing is like if attacker has the access to physical access it can bypass the cyber security measures so it will be leading to compromise the whole system and then then we can see that if the IP devices are basically they are running autonomously so if that has the excess of physical system then the whole system can be compromised and it can so as we can say that the physical system is vital for the overall system production and uh we also need to say that the physical security is essential because safety and the Integrity of the iot ecosystem is also very valuable in iot devices what can happen in in the physical security threats first it can be iot device can be tempered so the attacker can steal or alter the iot devices the devices can be sto so device St is is another threat in iot devices and thirdly Signal interference attacker can J the wireless data and they can like interference between the signals and lastly it will the main things our concern is the note capture because attackers can capture the notes and uh they can extra the cred I start talking about the case study about iot physical security threats so we are assuming a scenario where the homeowner is going for a vacation and he actually updated his authentication list there there is a revoked user but uh due to connection issue that couldn't syn to the server and and um the adversary took that opportunity and actually he turned off the Wi-Fi and access the home due to this actually he has the whole access for the home and uh the physical device couldn't connect to the server that's so evok list couldn't syn with the server and he uh he actually exploited that situation moving on to the second case study which was a physical security threat in unattended devices of military so most of the scenario in military war zone they put a lot of devices to collect the real time information about the uh enemy uh but most of the time these devices are unattended so there are there is a opportunity for adver adversaries to collect that device and uh do the reverse engineering and collect all the information that the enemy team is getting so this is a physical threat for iot device so moving on to the hard case study which is about the meter ID duplication so what happened a physical tempering happened on the I devices specifically you know iton Central cl200 Smart Meters so what the researchers did they captured a device they actually uh reverse engineered the device and got the device ID and they use that ID to replicate it into the another device so both devices have the same ID this could lead to energy theft intrig Integrity problems and other problems regarding iot device physical security this is a last case study which happened on the Google M thermostat so there was a vulnerability the attackers took the device and they pressed the hard reset button that uh then the device went to the device firware update mode and they inser inserted a malicious uh USB device that that has the malare in it and that gave him the loot access of the device so this led to um Network this led to network attacks and also the privacy concerns of the home owners so that that actually broke the trust between the smart home owners and the company uh there are a lot of policies for physican physical security of iot devices like surveillance and monitoring so iot devices are small and they can be actually implemented in distant areas so we should monitor them so that no devices left unattended the second one is anti theft mechanism uh it is not fible but still we can track them by GPS and the third one is robust design for resilience you know there's no standardization in iot devices so most of the time the vendors use the low grade materials so it is a big opportunity for the adversary or attackers so they G gain the opportunity and uh reverse engineer the device so if we make a standard design protocol then it could solve it could be solved secure disposal it is one of the biggest concern because most of the time the small devices are left uned and uh they throw it without the actual decommission process so the attackers can gain those devices and they can get uh like valuable informations Network informations or access from those devices there are many challenges in implementing those it devices and the securing the physical security but we have added only three one of the main reason uh challenges are cost so high cost of physically securing many distributive ID devices like I talked in the in my previous slide that we can track it using the GPS we can make a standardization uh in the design so that will be costly and the second one is device size so securing the physical devices is challenging because most of the ID devices are pretty much small and sometimes we cannot see uh that is around us like a smart watch we often forgot forget that uh this is a iot device another one is uh remote location like I talked in the cas study that military uses the IOD devices to collect information but that is in the distant area where there is no human supervision so anyone can get the device and uh reverse Engineers those device to get the information this is a work plan so our initial plan is to research on the system physical security of for IOD devices that that is almost done that is completed and uh the next plan is to uh in actually complete the thread identification vulnerability analysis and also design of physical security protocols we Al we are also trying to implement a attack on the physical device of the for for iot and also eval we'll do the evaluation and report after we implement the uh security protocol and also the attacks well at the end of our presentation we already talked about the importance of system physical security in iot devices like uh there are lot of attacks lot of vulnerabilities you can see physical SE is one of the most crucial part in for iot devices uh so if we can maintain the physical security the device is temper proof and also attackers are not gaining data from the devices devices are not unattended so those are the main points of system physical security for iot devices
